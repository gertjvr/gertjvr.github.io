I have been programming since I can remember if it wasnâ€™t the video recorder for my mum, then it was whatever electronic device I can get my hands on.

Studied B.Sc Information Technology at Johannesburg University in South Africa, with Computer Science and Informatics as my majors.

Visited my parents in Wollongong, Australia in 2006; and moved to Brisbane in 2007.

Married to a gorgeous girl that stole my heart, and will soon be a proud first time father.

My professional career I have been ~~un~~fortunate to code in many languages (VB6, Excel, Microsoft Access, TSQL, Java, Delpi 7, Turbo C, VB.Net C#) but my language of choice must be C#.
